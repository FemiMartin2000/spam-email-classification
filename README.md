# Spam Email Classification

This repository demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for classifying emails as spam or ham using a Jupyter Notebook. The project covers data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation using NLP techniques.

## Overview

The pipeline includes the following steps:

- **Data Loading:** Reads the dataset from `SPAM.csv` containing emails labeled as 'spam' or 'ham'.
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - **Tokenization:** Splits text messages into individual words.
  - **Stemming:** Uses NLTKâ€™s Snowball Stemmer to reduce words to their root form.
  - **Lemmatization:** Applies WordNetLemmatizer to convert tokens to their base form.
  - **Stopword Removal:** Eliminates common stopwords to improve feature quality.
- **Feature Extraction:** Converts processed text into numerical features using TF-IDF.
- **Classification:**  
  - Trains and evaluates models using **Logistic Regression** and **LinearSVC**, both achieving an accuracy of 87.5% on the dataset.

## Files

- **spam_classification.ipynb:** The main Jupyter Notebook containing the full pipeline.
- **SPAM.csv:** The dataset file with spam and ham emails.

## Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FemiMartin2000/spam-email-classification.git
   cd spam-email-classification
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk
   ```

3. **Download NLTK Resources:**

   You can download the necessary NLTK resources by running the following commands in a Python shell or in a notebook cell:

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```

### Running the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the `spam_classification.ipynb` file.
3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the pipeline.
